# IBM_OptimalForaging
C++ source code for the individual-based model of optimal foraging in white storks introduced in Zurell et al. (2015) Oikos. The model predicts the spatial structure and breeding success of white stork populations in heterogeneous landscapes by explicitly simulating foraging behaviour and home range formation of individuals competing for resources. Because resource depletion is modelled explicitly, the model can predict the maximum carrying capacity of white stork breeding populations in different landscapes, and density-dependent breeding success by inducing fixed stork density levels below carrying capacity. Different behavioural options for the optimal foraging routine and the home range optimisation can be made, and the model also allows tracking individual movement paths. Please note that the code is not optimised for custom use. For any questions, please feel free to contact me via email.

The main file is breeding.cpp. An example landscape file is also included to run the model (lc_33_stat.txt).
